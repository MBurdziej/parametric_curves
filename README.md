This program generates animations of mathematical curves such as cycloid, epicycloid, hypocycloid, and the path traced by a rolling wheel on a curve defined by the user by providing a function.

1. Choose the type of curve: c - cycloid, e - epicycloid, h - hypocycloid, k - user-defined curve.
2. Enter the appropriate parameters according to the chosen curve.
3. Watch the animation
